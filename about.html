            <p>The fast development of information technologies and rapid digital data growth require 
                a new approach for ultrafast low-dissipative manipulation and storage of information. 
                Magnetoelectric and multiferroic materials, where the magnetic degree of freedom can be 
                controlled by electric field and vice versa, are very suitable for data storage media, 
                multi-state memories, and optoelectronic devices. Manipulation of both the charge and 
                magnetic order of these materials by light is very attractive as it could overcome the 
                disadvantages of existing systems that have limited speed and an enormous rise in energy 
                consumption. For this reason, LaMnO3 (LMO) based thin film heterostructures with controllable 
                physical properties are promising functional elements not only for data technology devices, 
                but also for other advanced nano-systems. The main ideas of the proposed Project are: i) to 
                develop novel concept for fabrication of single- and multi-doped LMO thin films and bilayer 
                heterostructures and ii) to confirm that controlled manipulation of physical properties of 
                the fabricated LMO-based thin films and heterostructures can be performed by light. Recognition 
                of a new vision about importance of optically induced magnetoelectric effects and increase of 
                fundamental knowledge in this field is crucial.</p><br>
            <p>Project activities will be organized as follows: i) to develop optimal conditions for deposition 
                of high-quality doped LMO epitaxial thin films (&lt;50 nm) by spin-coating of a polymer/metal 
                aqueous solution, ii) to design functional bilayer heterostructures by combination of epitaxial 
                magnetic LMO-based and ferroelectric titanate thin layers, iii) to demonstrate that controlled 
                manipulation of physical properties of the LMO-based films and heterostructures is possible by 
                light stimuli and iv) to fabricate prototype components. These objectives will be accomplished 
                by combining compatible experience, experimental skills and resources of all research team members.</p>
